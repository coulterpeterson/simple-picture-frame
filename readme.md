## Installation
* Clone repo
* Run `yarn` or `npm install`
  * There's a chance you may need to run `yarn global add http-server` for it to run properly
* Put your images in /images in the project root directory (create the directory if it doesn't already exist)
* Start the server with `yarn start` or `npm run start`
* Browse to localhost:8080 and you're off to the races 

## Development
* Make changes to the .js and .css files in /src
* Run `yarn build` or `npm run build` to have Webpack built the /dist/main.js file
* Refresh page or start server anew with `yarn start`
